assignment requirements:
- band reject and notch filter
- frequency convolution
- high frequency emphasis filter
- inverse filtering
- wiener filtering

Plan:
- Make a frequency domain class
    - can do band reject, notch filter
        - maybe returns the resulted removal (for part b of experiment 1)
    - works on FT objects
    - can convolve two FT objects, returning an FT object
    - high frequency emphasis filter with various parameters on FT object
    - can do inverse filtering
    - can do wiener filtering
- for experiment 4, just add a separate function that can generate gaussian noise on an image

Thoughts:
- a band reject filter is a multiplication between the frequency and a filter. so need a way to generate filters?
- add a constructor to FT to create a frequency representation with a given string (band-pass, notch, hfe)
