Welcome to my third programming assignment for CS 474, Image Processing. 

This project is structured into three executables, one for each problem of the assignment:
1. Experiment1
2. Experiment2
3. Experiment3

To run the code, simply try running the executable for that problem (./Experiment1). 

If your build environment is different than mine, you will have to remake the executables. 
- make sure you have 'make' installed and you can compile cpp code
- run 'make clean' in the project directory to remove any lingering executable or object files
- run 'make' in the project directory to build the executables
- run the executables!

NOTE: there will be errors but you can ignore them! (They are related to char* string stuff that doesn't really matter for this context and I'm not too keen on fixing it currently).
