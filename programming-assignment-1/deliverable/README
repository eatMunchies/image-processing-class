Welcome to my first programming assignment for CS 474, Image Processing. 

This project is structured into four executables, one for each problem of the assignment:
1. ImageSampling
2. ImageQuantization
3. HistogramEqualization
4. HistogramSpecification

To run the code, simply try running the executable for that problem. 

If your build environment is different than mine, you will have to remake the executables. 
- make sure you have 'make' installed and you can compile cpp code
- run 'make' in the project directory to build the executables
- run the executables!

Filepaths throughout the project are either hardcoded or initialized algorithmically. Regardless, it defaults to putting everything in the project directory, but adjust the code as needed for your setup.
