Welcome to my first programming assignment for CS 474, Image Processing. 

This project is structured into five executables, one for each problem of the assignment:
1. Correlation
2. Smoothing
3. Filtering
4. Derivatives
5. ExtraCredit

To run the code, simply try running the executable for that problem. 

Special Execution Instructions:
- For running the ./Correlation executable, you need to provide two arguments, <mask_filepath> and [image_filepath], where mask is the link to a pgm image that you want to use as the correlation mask and image_filepath which is the pgm image that you want to run the correlation on. Try using this command once you make the executable: ./Correlation "Pattern.pgm" "Image.pgm"
- For running the ./Filtering executable, you need to provide the mask size as an argument. 7 and 15 are good mask sizes. For example, try running ./Filtering 7.


If your build environment is different than mine, you will have to remake the executables. 
- make sure you have 'make' installed and you can compile cpp code
- run 'make clean' in the project directory to remove any lingering executable or object files
- run 'make' in the project directory to build the executables
- run the executables!

NOTE: there will be errors but you can ignore them! (They are related to char* string stuff that doesn't really matter for this context and I'm not too keen on fixing it currently).

Filepaths throughout the project are either hardcoded or initialized algorithmically. Regardless, it defaults to putting everything in the project directory, but adjust the code as needed for your setup.
