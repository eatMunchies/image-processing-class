Welcome to my first programming assignment for CS 474, Image Processing. 

This project is structured into five executables, one for each problem of the assignment:
1. Correlation
2. Smoothing
3. Filtering
4. Derivatives
5. ExtraCredit

To run the code, simply try running the executable for that problem. 

If your build environment is different than mine, you will have to remake the executables. 
- make sure you have 'make' installed and you can compile cpp code
- run 'make clean' in the project directory to remove any lingering executable or object files
- run 'make' in the project directory to build the executables
- run the executables!

NOTE: there will be errors but you can ignore them! (They are related to char* string stuff that doesn't really matter for this context and I'm not too keen on fixing it currently).

Filepaths throughout the project are either hardcoded or initialized algorithmically. Regardless, it defaults to putting everything in the project directory, but adjust the code as needed for your setup.
